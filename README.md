# Thermodynamics-Snookered
A 2020 computing project where I simulate a 2D thermodynamic system in python through the use of bouncing balls.

rak1618ComputingThermodynamics.docx.pdf is my Project report, it contains an explanantion of the problem, the mechanics of a 2D thermodynamic system and an explanation of how the code was implemented.

Classes.py creates classes for both balls and the container. These are called in the simulation class to create a system of balls with callable properties.

Simulation.py is a short file that imports Classes.py and runs the simulation. It has adjustable parameters that change the conditions of the system.
